# Planning

I think Fast.ai's course is a good overview, and a few people have already told me that going through the lectures are generally easy. I might take this as a first pass to the major topics, so I know what are some of the applications. This would be a good way for me to transition into project planning on my new teams.

I think the degree of overlaps between Coursera's Deep Learning & CS 231N might be higher, whereas the later being more rigorous. I am still debating which one to focus on now, so it might be useful to do a few trial runs.

## Trial Runs

* [Fast.ai](http://wiki.fast.ai/index.php/Main_Page): Top-down teaching approach by Jeremy Howard and Rachel Thomas. Specifically, I want to focus on the ones that use Keras (not Pytorch).

  * [Lecture 0](http://wiki.fast.ai/index.php/Lesson_0): The "surprise lecture" during the data institute launch. It was an introduction to convolutions and machine learning for computer vision
  * [Lecture 1](http://wiki.fast.ai/index.php/Lesson_1): Getting started with deep learning tools for computer vision
  * [Lecture 2](http://wiki.fast.ai/index.php/Lesson_2): The basic algorithms underlying deep learning
  * [Lecture 3](http://wiki.fast.ai/index.php/Lesson_3): New concepts I learned - data agumentation (to make the data richer), dropout (to avoid overfitting, where weights are randomly dropped), Batch normalization (where gradients are normalized every few batches). 

* [Coursera's Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning): Bottom-up teaching approach

* [Stanford CS 231N: Convolutional Neural Network](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/syllabus.html): This is highly recommended by Jiaying and Heerad. This is probably also the most rigorous course of the three mentioned here because it's an actual Stanford Course. I was told the Homeworks are superb and I should definitely do them.

  * [Lecture 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT1JzLTH4G4&list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv&index=1): Course Introduction, nothing substantial
  * [Lecture 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUX-nOEjG0&list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv&index=2): Introduction to K-nn, Linear Classifier, nothing that I don't already know.
  * [Lecture 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7iBpEHGVNc&index=3&list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv): Loss Functions and Optimizations, nothing that I don't already know.

  Both courses have versions from the previous years, I might want to check that out too!
