# Progress

For this deliberate practice, I ended up doing something different - instead of learning **MULTIPLE concepts with a SINGLE source of book/material/MOOC**, I am trying out to **learn a SINGLE concept from MULTIPLE sources**. This is something that I have always wanted to do in graduate school (i.e. relearning the same concept multiple times, but in different ways), and I believe it's the right thing to do. It also happened that there are a lot of reputable DL materials at my disposal, and I have been reading and learning them all at once without too much trouble. So far, I enjoyed learning about the same concept from different angles, and I think it has the side benefit of [interleaving](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-interleaving-effect-mixing-it-up-boosts-learning/).

## Topics

* Basics of Neural Network, Mathematical set up and formulation
* Loss Function, Optimization routines, Hyperparameter tuning
* How Forward Pass and Backward Propogation works
* Practical Advice for building ML Projects
* Convolutional Neural Network, image-based models
* Visualizing CNNs
* Recurrent Neural Network, Sequence Model, text-based models (**Deliberately leave this out**)
* Unsupervised Learning Techniques or Generative Models

I am deliberately leaving out RNN related stuff in fast.ai, Stanford course, Keras book, and Coursera DL specialization, because I want to focus on CNN for now. I will definitely revisit when I have enough grasp of CNNs.

## Organization

I have surveyed different courses in the past two weeks, and here is how I would characterize the courses and materials:

* **Concept Track**: If the goal is to quickly learn the concpets and jargons, I would start with fast.ai -> Coursera DL specialization. fast.ai talks about all the basic concepts and how they are used in a workflow (code flavor). Coursera DL specialization gives the intuition (more math, notation flavor explanation).

* **Math Track**: I would exclude fast.ai (there's basically no math involved). I would recommend Coursera DL specialization -> Stanford CS courses -> Deep Learning book. This order is in increasingly level of difficulty. For me, I love the intuition in Andrew's coursera courses (basic intro with basic math), but I find Stanford's course notes a lot more detailed and more rigorous. I prefer to use Coursera to gain intuition and Stanford's actual classes to learn the details.

* **Coding Track**: I would recommend fast.ai -> Francis Chollet's Keras Book. fast.ai is very practical, but it wraps a lot of Keras code in fast.ai's own library. I think Francis Chollet's treatment is more comprehensive. I would exclude Andrew's coursera exercises, and perhaps jump straight to Stanford's homework or on-the-job projects.

## Progress

### University Courses

		* Week 1:
			- Understand the importance of ML strategy for project/product iteration
			- The concept of orthogonalization (doing one thing at a time, early stopping is an anti-example)
			- Single evaluation metric (for each of comparison across models)
			- Satisficing and Optimizing metrics (one metric for optimization, and rest as constraints that need to be satisfied)
			- Train/Dev/Test (99%/1%/1% is appropriate for DL)
			- Make sure dev/test reflects the underlying true distribution
			- For perception based task, very important to use human-level performance as a proxy for bayes error. 
				- Delta between `human-level performance` and `training error` is called "avoidable bias"
				- Delta between `training error` and `dev set error` is called "variance"
		* Week 2:
			- For ML project, always build something quick and dirty, then reiterate
			- Doing manual error analysis to understand why ML model is not doing well
			- In DL era, be aware of the situations where training distribution != dev/test distribution
			- When diagnosing model performance: have the folllowing metrics
				- Human-level performance
				- Training set error (If training error >> human-level performance, it's "avoidable bias")
				- Training-dev set error (If training error >> training-dev error, it's "variance problem")
				- Dev set error (If training error ~ training-dev error >> dev set error, it's data distribution mismatch)
				- Test set error (If test error >> dev error, you might have overfitted dev set)
			- When there is data distribution mismatch, try to make training data as similar as dev/test as possible
			- When to use Transfer Learning (from A -> B):
				- Lower level concepts from A can be re-used for task B
				- There's a lot more data in task A than in task B
				- Task A and B have the same input
			- When to use Multi-task Learning (common in object detection):
				- Training on a set of tasks can all shared useful low level features
				- Usually, the amount of data required is about the same (so can combine forces)
				- Can train a big enough network to do well on the tasks at once
			- End-to-End Deep Learning
				- Pros: let the data speak, less hand-engineering features
				- Cons: may need a large amount of data, exclude potentially useful hand-designed features
				- The trade-off really depends on how much data there is. If a lot of data, less need for hand-designed features. If not a lot of data, hand-designed features are more helpful.

				- landmark -> `y = (pc, [landmark x, landmark y]*m, one-hot encoding)`, m is defined by the number of landmarks we want to track -> this is how AR works
				- object detection -> `y = ([(pc, [landmark x, landmark y]*, one-hot encoding)] * m)`, for m different bounding boxes
