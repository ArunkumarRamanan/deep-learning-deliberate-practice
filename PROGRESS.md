# Planning

I think Fast.ai's course is a good overview, and a few people have already told me that going through the lectures are generally easy. I might take this as a first pass to the major topics, so I know what are some of the applications. This would be a good way for me to transition into project planning on my new teams.

I think the degree of overlaps between Coursera's Deep Learning & CS 231N might be higher, whereas the later being more rigorous. I am still debating which one to focus on now, so it might be useful to do a few trial runs.

## Organization

I have surveyed different courses in the past two weeks, and here is how I would characterize the courses and materials:

* **Concept Track**: If the goal is to quickly learn the concpets and jargons, I would start with fast.ai -> Coursera DL specialization. fast.ai talks about all the basic concepts and how they are used in a workflow (code flavor). Coursera DL specialization gives the intuition (more math, notation flavor explanation).

* **Math Track**: I would exclude fast.ai (there's basically no math involved). I would recommend Coursera DL specialization -> Stanford CS courses -> Deep Learning book. This order is in increasingly level of difficulty. For me, I love the intuition in Andrew's coursera courses (basic intro with basic math), but I find Stanford's course notes a lot more detailed and more rigorous. I prefer to use Coursera to gain intuition and Stanford's actual classes to learn the details.

* **Coding Track**: I would recommend fast.ai -> Francis Chollet's Keras Book. fast.ai is very practical, but it wraps a lot of Keras code in fast.ai's own library. I think Francis Chollet's treatment is more comprehensive. I would exclude Andrew's coursera exercises, and perhaps jump straight to Stanford's homework or on-the-job projects.

## Progress

* [Fast.ai](http://wiki.fast.ai/index.php/Main_Page): Top-down teaching approach by Jeremy Howard and Rachel Thomas. Specifically, I want to focus on the ones that use Keras (not Pytorch).

  * [Lecture 0](http://wiki.fast.ai/index.php/Lesson_0): The "surprise lecture" during the data institute launch. It was an introduction to convolutions and machine learning for computer vision
  * [Lecture 1](http://wiki.fast.ai/index.php/Lesson_1): Getting started with deep learning tools for computer vision
  * [Lecture 2](http://wiki.fast.ai/index.php/Lesson_2): The basic algorithms underlying deep learning
  * [Lecture 3](http://wiki.fast.ai/index.php/Lesson_3): New concepts I learned - data agumentation (to make the data richer), dropout (to avoid overfitting, where weights are randomly dropped), Batch normalization (where gradients are normalized every few batches).
  * [Lecture 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2h3IOBDvrA&feature=youtu.be): Mainly about optimization techniques - momentum, RMSprop, ADAM. 

* [Coursera's Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning): Bottom-up teaching approach

* [Stanford CS 231N: Convolutional Neural Network](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/syllabus.html): This is highly recommended by Jiaying and Heerad. This is probably also the most rigorous course of the three mentioned here because it's an actual Stanford Course. I was told the Homeworks are superb and I should definitely do them.
